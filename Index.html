    <p>This index file is messed up because it was capitalized. An index file should not be listed in a directory.</p>
    <p>The contents are perfectly okay. We can right click on it and see no "flags". </p>
    <p>We can copy the URL and see that it validates <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">here.</a>
